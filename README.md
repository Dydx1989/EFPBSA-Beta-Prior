# EFPBSA-Beta-Prior
Bayesian Penalized Cox-PH using Beta Prior

## To demonstrate the simulation scenarios. Kindly use the following files: 
* Simulation_Gamma_GL_MDPI_1 (.R): This is for the choice Group Lasso
* Simulation_Gamma_EN_MDPI_1 (.R): This is for the choice of Elastic Net
Each can implement both Gamma or Beta processes prior for the cumulative hazard ratio.

## To demonstrate the real-life datasets. Kindly use the following files: 
* REAL_life_nki70 (.R) 
* REAL_life_ DutchBC(.R)
* Real_Life_DLBCL_chop (.R)
Here, you can also choose your choice of prior for  the cumulative hazard ratio and select your choice on penalty function (Group Lasso and Elastic Net)
